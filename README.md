**Requirements:**

- There will be 2 types of users, Clients and Administrators.
- Admin record will include name, ID, phone number and email address.
- Each customer will need to fill a form that includes name, ID, address, phone
    number and email address.s
- Products will include name, ID, photo, description, price, quantity in stock and

- Carts are emptied only on payment or by customers.
- Administrators can create/read/update/delete new products.
- We will have a purchase history for the customer. So they can see what they
    bought in our store.

**Comments About the Code:**

We are at the first milestone, so we don’t have enough code to comment.

**Test Plan:**

We are at the first milestone, so we don’t have enough data to start testing our store.

**Test Results:**


We are at the first milestone and we don’t have a test plan, so it’s obvious that we
don’t have the test results.

**Build Procedures:**

We are at the first milestone, so we don’t have enough data or code to instruct
someone how to run our code.

**Problems:**

We are at the first milestone, so we are thinking about what we will implement and
how, so we didn’t have any problem.

**Comments:**

We are at the first milestone, so we don’t have anycomments to add here.
